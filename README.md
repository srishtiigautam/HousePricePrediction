## Introduction

Predicting house prices is a common and essential task in real estate and finance. This project focuses on using data analysis and machine learning to build accurate house price prediction models. By following the steps outlined in this repository that contains:

- Collecting and preprocessing housing data.
- Analyzing the dataset to gain insights.
- Selecting and implementing various machine learning models.
- Evaluating model performance.
- Making house price predictions.

## Data

The dataset used for this project can be found in the `/dataset` directory. It includes various features such as the number of bedrooms, square footage, neighborhood information, and more. 

## Data Analysis

Before building the machine learning models, a thorough data analysis is performed to understand the dataset better. Jupyter notebooks with detailed analysis and visualization can be found in the repo. Exploration has been done for correlations, distributions, and key insights that can help us build better models.

## Machine Learning Models

We employ a variety of machine learning models for house price prediction. The models are implemented using popular libraries like Scikit-Learn and TensorFlow. The models include:

- Linear Regression
- Decision Trees
- Random Forest
- Gradient Boosting
- Neural Networks (Deep Learning)
